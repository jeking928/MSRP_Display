Upgraded for Zen Cart v 1.3.9x  by Delia Wilson Lunsford, www.deliawilsondesign.com, www.zencartdelia.com
Upgraded for Zen Cart 1.5 by Ray
Modification code by bigsy85, implemented by KetchTech
Eror fix by Design75
Updated for Zen Cart v 1.5.4 to match 1.5.4 admin files by Frank Riegel (frank18) www.isonetwork.net.au
Added bugfix in MSRP v1.3.1 which caused prices not showing
------------------------------------------------------------------

This modification allows you to show that your store price is lower than the manufacturer's suggested retail price. If your price is the same as or higher than the MSRP, then the MSRP will not be displayed. The customer's savings will also be displayed if it applies. Savings is based on the MSRP if it applies or on the selling price if a sale price is in effect.
